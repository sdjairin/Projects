### Project 1: E-commerce website using the MERN-stack

This project is a fully functional e-commerce website built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It offers a seamless shopping experience for users and robust management tools for administrators.

The front-end, crafted with React and styled using Tailwind CSS, provides a modern, responsive, and intuitive user interface. On the back-end, Express.js and Node.js power a secure and efficient API, while MongoDB handles all data storage.

A key feature of this platform is the dedicated admin panel, which allows for efficient order management and utilizes Stripe for secure and streamlined payment processing. This project showcases a comprehensive understanding of full-stack development, from user-facing design to secure data handling and payment integration.

**Key Features:**
* MERN Stack Implementation: The entire project is built using MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, demonstrating a modern full-stack approach.
* React Front-end: The user interface is developed with React, ensuring a dynamic and interactive user experience.
* Tailwind CSS Styling: Tailwind CSS is used for front-end styling, indicating proficiency with utility-first CSS frameworks and enabling a clean, responsive design.
